# Regulatory Proof Points

## The Ungoverned Seam: Governments Are Taking Notice

### December 2024: NY enacts first-in-nation AI disclosure law for advertising
- Requires "conspicuous disclosure" of synthetic performers
- $1,000-$5,000 penalties per violation
- Effective June 2026

### Illustrative scenario: EU DSA transparency fine (hypothetical example)
- Included as an illustrative enforcement scenario to highlight audit-trail and transparency expectations
- If used externally, ensure you cite a verifiable public enforcement action (or keep this explicitly labeled as hypothetical)

## The Message

This isn't pitch theater. This is documented regulatory gap.

The "ungoverned seam" between enterprises and partners isn't just an operational risk—it's becoming a regulatory liability. And the regulatory bar is moving from "have a policy" to "prove you followed it."
