# AICOMPLYR Project Context

## What We're Building
AICOMPLYR is the governance layer at the enterprise-partner boundary. We govern AI tool usage between regulated enterprises (pharma first) and their external partners, providing shared compliance that works for both sides.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions in Deno/TypeScript)
- **API Layer:** Express.js on Railway
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces

## Key Architecture Concepts
- Multi-tenant: Enterprise → Workspace → User context
- RLS (Row-Level Security) for tenant isolation
- 17+ AI agents for governance orchestration
- Proof bundles with cryptographic verification

## Current Phase
Pre-beta launch. Focus on:
1. Security hardening (RLS policies)
2. Database cleanup
3. End-to-end testing

## Approved Terminology
- "Enterprise" = Client organization (pharma company)
- "Partner" = Agency/vendor working for the enterprise
- "Proof Bundle" = Cryptographic compliance evidence package
- "The Forge" = Policy Studio editor
- "Evidence Vault" = Audit trail viewer
